# qsql

(Pronounced as **keskel**)

A library for creating and managing relational databases focused on the developer experience.

Heavily inspired by [Lapis](https://leafo.net/lapis)

[Ver em portuguÃªs](README.pt.md)

# **Goals**

- Provide a uniform way to work with the various types of relational databases
- Allow easy database integration with programming languages

# **Why?**

Working with especially relational databases, usually creates a structural dependency forcing the developer to modify the application and database code together.

qsql tries to reduce this dependency to the maximum.

# **How?**

We can summarize in one word:

### **Simplicity**

Queries are generated based on simple and practical methods, drastically reducing development time.

```C++

for(auto user : User.findAll()){
    cout << user["firstName"] << std::endl;
}

User.update(1,{ "firstName", "John Doe" });

```
